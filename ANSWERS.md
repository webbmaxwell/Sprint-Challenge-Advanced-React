- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

- Class components allow you to manipulate state much more effectively.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

- componentDidMount is used to manipulate the DOM or immediately set state, componentDidUpdate is for after the component has updated, and componentWillUnmount is used to clean up or reset the previous two methods between renders.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

- To apply stateful logic to a re-useable piece of code. Ultimately it is to keep our code DRY.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

- There are several reasons testing apps is important. First, it helps us catch potential errors or problems with our code. Second, it is good practice for thinking ahead to the user experience since we start thinking of exceptions or irregular cases that might cause the code to fail.
